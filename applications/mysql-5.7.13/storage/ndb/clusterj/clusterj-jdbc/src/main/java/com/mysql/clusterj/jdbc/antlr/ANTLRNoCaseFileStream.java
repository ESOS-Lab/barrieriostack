/** This is a char buffer stream that is loaded from a file

 *  much like an ANTLReader or ANTLRInputStream, but it's a special case
 *  since we know the exact size of the object to load.  We can avoid lots
 *  of data copying.
 *  The only difference to ANTLRFileStream is that it extends ANTLRNoCaseStringStream.
