How to map a method:

- Add it to the appropriate class or interface
  - const methods belong in the xxxConst interface
  - non-const methods belong in the implementing class
  - constructors are mapped using a create method with the same parameters as the constructor

  for example, add the c++ constructor Ndb_cluster_connection(const char *, int)
  add a method create(String, int) to class Ndb_cluster_connection
  this makes it visible to the application
  edit com/mysql/ndbjtie/ndbapi/Ndb_cluster_connection.java
  compile the class via make

- Add it to the implementation
  - run javah on the compiled class
    javah -classpath target/classes com.mysql.ndbjtie.ndbapi.Ndb_cluster_connection
    the result will be in the file com_mysql_ndbjtie_ndbapi_Ndb_cluster_connection.h
  - edit ndbapi_jtie.hpp
      copy the new method definition from the javah output and put it in the same place as javah put it
      implement the new method
      copy from other methods
