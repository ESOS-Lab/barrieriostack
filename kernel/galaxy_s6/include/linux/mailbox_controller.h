 *		context try to transmit a message on the bus. Returns 0 if
 *		data is accepted for transmission, -EBUSY while rejecting
 *		if the remote hasn't yet read the last data sent. Actual
 *		transmission of data is reported by the controller via
 *		mbox_link_txdone (if it has some TX ACK irq). It must not
 *		block.
 * @startup:	Called when a client requests the link. The controller
 *		could ask clients for additional parameters of communication
 *		to be provided via client's link_data. This call may
 *		block. After this call the Controller must forward any
 *		data received on the link by calling mbox_link_received_data.
 * @shutdown:	Called when a client relinquishes control of a link.
 *		This call may block too. The controller must not forwared
 *		any received data anymore.
 * @last_tx_done: If the controller sets 'txdone_poll', the API calls
 *		  this to poll status of last TX. The controller must
 *		  give priority to IRQ method over polling and never
 *		  set both txdone_poll and txdone_irq. Only in polling
 *		  mode 'send_data' is expected to return -EBUSY.
 *		  Used only if txdone_poll:=true && txdone_irq:Ãºlse
