config SCSI_UFSHCD
	tristate "Universal Flash Storage Controller Driver Core"
	depends on SCSI && SCSI_DMA
	select PM_DEVFREQ
	select DEVFREQ_GOV_SIMPLE_ONDEMAND
	---help---
	This selects the support for UFS devices in Linux, say Y and make
	  sure that you know the name of your UFS host adapter (the card
	  inside your computer that "speaks" the UFS protocol, also
	  called UFS Host Controller), because you will be asked for it.
	  The module will be called ufshcd.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/ufs.txt>.
	  However, do not compile this as a module if your root file system
	  (the one containing the directory /) is located on a UFS device.

config UFS_DYNAMIC_H8
	bool "UFS Dynamic Hibernation (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD

config SCSI_UFSHCD_PCI
	tristate "PCI bus based UFS Controller support"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && PCI
	---help---
	This selects the PCI UFS Host Controller Interface. Select this if
	you have UFS Host Controller with PCI Interface.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM
	tristate "Platform bus based UFS Controller support"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD
	---help---
	This selects the UFS host controller support. Select this if
	you have an UFS controller on Platform bus.

	If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_EXYNOS
	tristate "EXYNOS UFS Host Controller Driver"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM
	---help---
	  This selects the EXYNOS UFS host controller driver.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config FIPS_FMP_UFS
	tristate "EXYNOS FMP UFS Test for FIPS"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM && FMP
	---help---
	  This selects EXYNOS FMP UFS Self-Test driver for FIPS.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config UFS_BKOPS_NODE_UID
	int "User ID of BKOPS sysfs node"
	default 1000
	help
	  Owner user ID of BKOPS sysfs node.
	  Default is 0. Do not touch the value if unsure.

config UFS_BKOPS_NODE_GID
	int "Group ID of BKOPS sysfs node"
	default 1001
	help
	  Owner group ID of BKOPS sysfs node.
	  Default is 0. Do not touch the value if unsure.

choice
	prompt "Option for self-test failure"
	depends on FIPS_FMP_UFS
	default NODE_FOR_SELFTEST_FAIL

config NODE_FOR_SELFTEST_FAIL
	bool "Set fips fmp node when self-test fails"
	depends on FIPS_FMP_UFS
	help
	   This select that fips fmp node was set to zero when FMP self-test fails.

config PANIC_FOR_SELFTEST_FAIL
	bool "Panic when self-test fails"
	depends on FIPS_FMP_UFS
	help
	   This select that kernel panic occurs when FMP self-test fails.
