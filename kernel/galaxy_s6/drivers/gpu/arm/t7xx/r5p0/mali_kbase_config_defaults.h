 * not prevent a lower priority non-fragment atom from running (and vice
 * versa). This allows lower priority non-fragment atoms to run in parallel,
 * reducing serializaition/latency but with a risk that both will run more
 * slowly.
 *
 * When set to 1, Atom Priority scheduling considers both Fragment and
 * non-fragment atoms. Hence, a high priority atom prevents all atoms of lower
 * priority from running on the GPU, regardless of their type. This serializes
 * the atoms of different priorities, which might lead to high
 * latency. However, it helps prevent low priority atoms from stealing
 * resources from higher priority atoms. For example, a low priority
 * vertex/compute job cannot steal threads from high priority Fragment jobs
