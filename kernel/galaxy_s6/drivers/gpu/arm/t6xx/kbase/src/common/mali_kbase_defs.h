/**
 * @brief States to model state machine processed by kbasep_js_job_check_ref_cores(), which
 * handles retaining cores for power management and affinity management.
 *
 * The state @ref KBASE_ATOM_COREREF_STATE_RECHECK_AFFINITY prevents an attack
 * where lots of atoms could be submitted before powerup, and each has an
 * affinity chosen that causes other atoms to have an affinity
 * violation. Whilst the affinity was not causing violations at the time it
 * was chosen, it could cause violations thereafter. For example, 1000 jobs
 * could have had their affinity chosen during the powerup time, so any of
 * those 1000 jobs could cause an affinity violation later on.
 *
 * The attack would otherwise occur because other atoms/contexts have to wait for:
 * -# the currently running atoms (which are causing the violation) to
 * finish
 * -# and, the atoms that had their affinity chosen during powerup to
 * finish. These are run preferrentially because they don't cause a
 * violation, but instead continue to cause the violation in others.
 * -# or, the attacker is scheduled out (which might not happen for just 2
 * contexts)
 *
 * By re-choosing the affinity (which is designed to avoid violations at the
 * time it's chosen), we break condition (2) of the wait, which minimizes the
 * problem to just waiting for current jobs to finish (which can be bounded if
 * the Job Scheduling Policy has a timer).
