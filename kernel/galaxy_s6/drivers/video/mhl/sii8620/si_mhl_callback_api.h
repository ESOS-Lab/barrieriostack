	   respond in the same way in which it would respond to a rising HPD
	   signal (which happens prior to the call).
	   Parameters:
	   *p_edid:

	   The processed EDID block(s) that the MHL driver has derived
	   from the downstream EDID and WRITE_BURST info associated with the
	   sink's responses to 3D_REQ (MHL 2.x) or FEAT_REQ (MHL 3.x and newer).

	   edid_length:

	   The length, in bytes, of the data in *p_edid

	   *p_hev_dtd:
	   The processed result of all the HEV_DTDA/HEV_DTDB WRITE_BURSTs
	   including the associated 3D_DTD VDI for each HEV_DTD pair.

	   num_hev_dtds:
	   The number of MHL3_hev_dtd_t elements in *p_hev_dtd.

	   p_hev_vic:
	   The processed result of all the HEV_VIC WRITE_BURSTs including
	   the associated 3D_VIC VDI for each HEV_DTD pair.

	   num_hev_vic_items:
	   The number of MHL3_hev_vic_item_t elements in p_hev_vic.

	   *p_3d_dtd_items:
	   The processed result of all the 3D_DTD WRITE_BURSTs including
	   the associated DTD from the EDID when VDI_H.HEV_FMT is zero.

	   num_3d_dtd_items:
	   The number of MHL3_3d_dtd_item_t elements in p_3d_dtd_items;

	   *p_3d_vic:
	   The processed result of all the 3D_VIC WRITE_BURSTs including
	   the associated VIC code from the EDID.

	   num_3d_vic_items:
	   The number of MHL3_3d_vic_item_t elements in p_3d_vic.

	   p_avif_or_dtd:

	   If the callee sends HDMI content, it shall fill in *p_avif_or_dtd
	   with the contents of its outgoing AVI info frame, including the
	   checksum byte, and return one of the values described under the
	   parameter p_vsif.

	   If the callee, sends DVI content, is shall fill in *p_avif_or_dtd
	   with a Detailed Timing Descriptor (defined in CEA-861D) that
	   accurately describes the timing parameters of the video which is
	   presented at the 8620's HDMI input and return one of:
	   HH_FMT_DVI
	   HH_FMT_DVI_HDCP_ON
	   HH_FMT_DVI_NOT_REPEATABLE
	   HH_FMT_DVI_HDCP_ON_NOT_REPEATABLE.

	   This buffer will be pre-initialized to zeroes prior to the call.

	   avi_max_length:

	   The length of the buffer pointed to by p_avif_or_dtd.

	   p_vsif:

	   A buffer into which the upstream driver should
	   write the contents of its outgoing vendor specific
	   info frame, if any, including the checksum byte.  This
	   buffer will be pre-initialized to zeroes prior to the call.

	   If the callee chooses to write an HDMI vendor specific info frame
	   into p_vsif, it shall return one of:
	   HH_FMT_HDMI_VSIF_HDMI
	   HH_FMT_HDMI_VSIF_HDMI_HDCP_ON
	   HH_FMT_HDMI_VSIF_HDMI_NOT_REPEATABLE
	   HH_FMT_HDMI_VSIF_HDMI_HDCP_ON_NOT_REPEATABLE.

	   If the callee chooses to write an MHL3 vendor specific info frame
	   into p_vsif, it shall return one of:
	   HH_FMT_HDMI_VSIF_MHL3
	   HH_FMT_HDMI_VSIF_MHL3_HDCP_ON
	   HH_FMT_HDMI_VSIF_MHL3_NOT_REPEATABLE
	   HH_FMT_HDMI_VSIF_MHL3_HDCP_ON_NOT_REPEATABLE.

	   If the callee does not write a vendor specific
	   info frame into this buffer, the callee shall return one of:
	   HH_FMT_HDMI_VSIF_NONE
	   HH_FMT_HDMI_VSIF_NONE_HDCP_ON
	   HH_FMT_HDMI_VSIF_NONE_NOT_RPT
	   HH_FMT_HDMI_VSIF_NONE_HDCP_ON_NOT_RPT
	   and the 8620 will infer the contents of the outgoing MHL3 VSIF from
	   the contents of the HDMI VSIF (if any) presented at the 8620's HDMI
	   input.

	   vsif_max_length:

	   The length of the buffer pointed to by p_vsif.

	   Return values for hpd_driven_high():

	   If the callee enabled video during the duration of this call, then
	   the callee shall return one of the values in
	   hpd_high_callback_status that do not have the sign bit set,
	   indicating the usage of parameters.

	   If the callee did not enable video during the duration of this call,
	   then the callee shall indicate specific reasons for not starting
	   video by returning the bitwise OR of the values in
	   hpd_high_callback_status that do have the sign bit set.
